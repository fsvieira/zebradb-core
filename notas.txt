- Problems:
    * The order witch tuples unify with facts its critical for a succefully program termination.
    
    * Ordering tuples is not a trivial task, the problem arises from missing important 
    growth control tuples when unifying operation are executed.
    Variables restriction is of most importance in unification since failing to restrict 
    variables on early phases can originate in a exponential growth of time and size, 
    leading application to crash or running for an unbarable length of time.
    
    * The missing tuples problem arises when facts have potential restriction tuples 
    but have not yet been unified with the query, so there are missing tuples on unifcation phase.
    Because of this the unification phase can not unify all available tuples presented on the query, 
    not having query variable correctly restricted increses the potential of growth exponentially.
    
    * Infinit tuple creation problem arises on infinite data, where tuples are defined as recursive/inductive.
    If the ordering strategy always chooses the facts that originates recursive tuples it will grow 
    to infinity.
    We can not avoid tuple creation because of [The missing tuple problem].
    
    * Basicly since there is no backtracking mechanism on the machine because all possible branchs are 
    extended on each step, so if one fail there is no need to go back a try another branch, we just 
    stop propagating failling branchs to result.
    This originates to a few problems:
        * Higth demand for resources (time and space),
        * Can't efficiantly search for the n-th solutions (we demand all or nothing),
        * No exponential growth of solutions, since backtraking will check one solution at a time.

- Solution:
    * In the end what we need is a planner, unfortunately planner problems are not trivial 
    and there is no optimal general planner algoritm.
    
    * The current architecture works with phases:
        1. Extratc all unchecked tuples from the query, if none return results,
        2. Unify all unchecked tuples with facts (check),
        3. Query results from previews step (1).

    * The planner can be introduced on point 2 of the architecture, insted of 
    unifiyng all unchecked tuples they should carefully selected for unification.
    

- Planner:
    * Since our planner is just a matter of chosing the correct tuples for unifcation 
    phase, it can be expressed as a function, the oracle we call them.

Lazzy Unify System:
    * Problems:
        - lazzy hierarchy structures lead to information partition and duplication, 
        it also leads to problems of child terms are not aware of higther equal 
        terms on the tree structure, witch lead to bad results and fail delays.
    
    * Solutions:

    - Structure
        1. keep a doubled linked list on terms:
            - this will allow easy compare of original tuples,
            - delete and link other unifies
            - not so good for managing since we will need to code aditional functions:
                - insert with no duplicates,
                - transverse the list from arbitary positions,
                - search
        2. keep a unify structure:
            - the structure should map term indexes to an array of unify arrays of indexes,
            - ex:
                {terms: {1: 0, 2: 0, ...}, unifies: [[1, 2], ...]}
            - Using native strutures means less code needed to implement managing functions,
            - comparing to original tuples will not change, but new comparing functions 
            will be needed.
            - defer function must manage delete, insert and merge unify structures and keep them updated,
            - managing functions should be added:
                - core functions: let unify decide when to insert, delete and merge unification info, or,
                - higth level functions: let writer manage everything, give feedback (callback, promisses) to unification functions.



======================
Coding questions?
    - Should validation be performed on code?
        - ex: types, dont allow not to have empty data
