# zebrajs

ATENTITON: This is still a beta version, many things can change, and not everything is working.

Zebrajs is a logical symbolic computation query system, given a set of computational definitions it will
answer questions about them, therefor Zebrajs is better suited for software validation and constrain satisfaction problems.

Zebrajs system consists of two parts the definitions and the query, both parts share the same language of zebra-system terms, which is defined by
a certain formal syntax, and a set of transformation rules.

The zebra language is very simple, it only has constants, variables, tuples and negation.

But because its hard to explain how it works, I will do it with examples:

## Examples

* Defintions, are considered facts they are always tuples and always global.
  * Ex: (color yellow)
  * In this example color and yellow are constants, constants don't need to be declared anywhere 
because we consider that all constants exists.
* Queries, are questions to the system definitions (facts),
  * Ex: ?(color yellow)
  * Because definitions/facts are tuples, all querys are also tuples,
  * In this example the system will check if any of the definitions unify with the query,
    if yes the result will be the tuple itself: (color yellow)
  * If there is no awnser then the system will return nothing.
* Queries, may also be inner tuples of queries or definitions
  * The ideia is quite simple, a fact is only valid if all contained tuples that are also valid facts.
  * Ex: (man (person 'name) (male 'name) 'name)
    * This fact is invalid because there is no (person 'name) or (male 'name) definitions,
    * Here the 'name is a variable, all variables have the ' as prefix,
    * You can also define anonimous variables, just use ' without a name,
    * If we add the facts:
      * (person filipe)
      * (male filipe)
    * The the fact would be valid and the query:
      * ?(man ' ' 'man), returns:
      * (man (person filipe) (male filipe) filipe)
* Negation, its true if a negated query doens't exist, negtion querys are hidden and are not considered to unification,
 Â * Ex: 
    * (equal 'x 'x) 
    * (color yellow) 
    * (color blue)
    * ?(color 'x ^(equal 'x yellow))
  * The query should return:
    * (color blue)
  * Basiclly what we are saying is we want color 'x but that will not be equal with color yellow,
  * Because we are negating a query negation can only be applied to a tuple,
* Thats it.


## Tests

A great source of examples are the test file https://github.com/fsvieira/zebrajs/tree/master/test

* If you want to run the tests:
  * Execute mocha (http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/).
  * You also will need to install should (https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js).


## History/Road map (WIP)

* 2.0.0 (WIP)
  * Add support to finit representation of infinity structures (ex: (nat 'x) -> 'x => (nat 'x))
* 1.0.0 version
  * [ ] Add examples, solve brave puzzle (http://www.mathsisfun.com/puzzles/a-brave-puzzle.html)
* beta version (new)
  * [ ] get all examples working,
  * [ ] get all tests working


** beta version (2016-03-07) **
  This version had a few things that I had to rethink, so the changes to the new version are:
  
  * The "not" was a not by value and I decided to replace it with a "not exist", this means that I negate a query
  insted a value. I think this kind of not is more versatil and much more clear. Also the "not exists" works 
  like a condition and not as part of the result. 
  
  * The ignore was removed but only becase at this phase I need to get a stable version and than reavaluate the 
  need of the ignore.
  
  * Optimize the way data was stored, I implemented version system with immutable data.

* beta version (2016-03-07)
  * [x] Optimize (solve all [current] tests under 20 seconds, optimal < 2s),
  * [x] Remove duplicated results,
* alfa version (2015-10-22)
  * [x] Clean up and rename files, functions,
  * [x] Add "multiply" results support,
  * [x] Fix tools,
  * [x] Fix imports and zlib tests,
  * [x] Add ignore "_" term support.

** pre-alfa version **
  The first version was a implementation of variables as js objects with some features of unification,
  the ideia was to provide flexible tools to let the programmer choose their own search algoritms.
  The problem with this aproach is that the system only have partial information of the 
  problem is trying to solve, so it is very restricted on decisions that it can make.
  This makes it hard to optmize the system so I decided to resutruct next version of the system and give him
  full control and information.
