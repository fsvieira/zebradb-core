<h1>zebrajs</h1>

zebrajs is a constrain problem solving lib made in javascript. The goal of the lib is to provide tools to solve constrain problems like sudoku, zebra (aka Einstein puzzle) or any other problem defined with constrains.

The zebrajs variables are defined in a way that they dont depend on any search algoritm leting users to define their own methods: such as deep search, backtracking, genetic search...

The core of zebra lib are the variables.
