# Design Guidelines

To ensure that Zebradb stays true to its foundational principles, 
this section outlines a set of design guidelines that provide a compass for its development. 

These guidelines emphasize simplicity, clarity, and universality. 
They enable Zebradb to remain a versatile tool that promotes user-centric, intuitive interactions.


## Principles

  1. **Define WHAT you want, not HOW to achieve it:** Users should focus on defining their subjects of interest using simple, precise, and explicit definitions, leaving the query system to handle the complex task of finding the answers they seek.
  2. **Define concepts, not operators:** This principle emphasizes defining concepts or ideas that contribute to a cohesive and intuitive language design. The introduction of new language features should align with these core concepts, not the other way around.
  3. **Prioritize Simplicity in Design:** The Zebradb language should be simple to use, emphasizing ease of expression and readability.
  4. **Unified query, definitions and results dialect:** Zebradb should maintain a consistent and familiar language for both defining concepts, querying and results.
  5. **Familiar concepts from common knowledge and accepted formalizations in relevant fields of interest:** The language should draw on familiar concepts from common knowledge and accepted formalizations in various domains to ensure user accessibility.
  6. **Simplify the complex, don't complex the simple:** When adding new features/concepts, the language should ensure that simple tasks remain simple, while also providing powerful tools for more complex tasks.
